'''
The class RabbitThread is the parallel thread that is
responsible for the asynchronous communication with the
RabbitMQ server.

It has several submodules that do the actual work - connecting
to RabbitMQ, publishing messages, receiving confirms, handling
connection problems, ... (Those submodules are named "thread_...").

RabbitThread implements its own thread, which, after connecting to
RabbitMQ, basically stays in a blocking loop (ioloop) waiting
for events.

These events can come from the RabbitMQ (via defined callback
methods) or from the main thread. Only the connector object
(AsynchronousRabbitConnector) has a reference to the thread and
passes events to it.

The RabbitThread provides some methods to be called by the main
thread, i.e. by the AsynchronousRabbitConnector, which use pika's
SelectConnection.add_timeout() to pass the event to the thread's
blocking loop.

Only the methods
 * run()
 * add_event_publish_message()
 * add_event_gently_finish()
 * add_event_force_finish()
should be called from the AsynchronousRabbitConnector.

All other methods are thread-UNsafe and to be used by the
RabbitThread's submodules only. They are only public to
enable the submodules to communicate among each other
without needed references to each other.
